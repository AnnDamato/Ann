      Ann D'Amato Artell Ann D'Amato Artell, age 97, passed away peacefully
      December 13, 2019, at the home of her son Robert and his wife Marybeth.
      Annie, a nickname that encapsulated her spirit, was born February 20, 1922
      in New Milford, Connecticut to Anna and Sabato D'Amato. She was the wife
      of the late Edwin S. Artell, Sr. Annie was a force of nature, living
      independently until the last days of her life. Former Norwalk Mayor Tom
      O'Connor once commented, "If you could harness her energy you could light
      the entire city." That energy was demonstrated by her numerous list of
      accomplishments: 24 years as Registrar of Voters, co-owner Quality Homes
      Real Estate Agency, member of several real estate boards, Norwalk Election
      Coordinator for Congressman, Stewart McKinney, Governor Thomas Meskill,
      and several presidents, delegate to the 1980 National Republican
      Convention nominating Ronald Reagan for President, first president of the
      Norwalk High School Alumni Association, chairperson and board member
      N.E.O.N., president of the Norwalk Business and Professional Women's
      Association, and so much more. All this achieved by this Class of 1939
      Norwalk High School graduate. Of course all that energy meant she loved to
      have fun. In social situations, Annie was the life of the party. She loved
      to dance especially to big band jazz but readily adapted to rock and roll.
      She enjoyed summers with her family on Long Beach Island at the Jersey
      shore, often joined by a gang of her close friends. Annie was an
      adventurous and constant traveler. Her itineraries included much of North
      America, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. There is a photo of her in
      Egypt riding a camel. A devout Catholic, she worked tirelessly in a number
      of roles for her church. Representing the Bridgeport Diocese, she
      volunteered as VIP guide for the Vatican Pavilion at the 1964 World's
      Fair. She co-chaired a major fundraiser that resulted in the creation of a
      retired priests home in Stamford. When her sons attended Fairfield Prep,
      she become a leader in the Bellarmine Guild, a group that brought together
      Fairfield Prep faculty, parents, care-givers and students. All knew her as
      a happy positive force, generous and fair minded. She was impressed by a
      person's character and not their social status. She believed all should be
      treated fairly and this was the guiding force of her life. The Honor
      America Committee accurately described Ann as a unique person who made
      unceasing contributions to numerous religious, political, educational and
      civic activities epitomizing the best of what is within us all. She was
      loved by many and will be missed by all. Annie has now joined her three
      siblings, Mary (D'Amato) Somers Marino, Victor D'Amato, and John D'Amato.
      She is survived by her sons Edwin S. Artell, Jr. and his wife Bonnie and
      Robert Artell and his wife Marybeth Sullivan, six loving grandchildren,
      Christine and her husband Joe, Lauren and her husband Chris, Whitney,
      Ryan, James and Annie (her namesake), 5 great-grandchildren, Christopher,
      Isabelle, Kirstin, Samuel, and Dante, nephews and nieces, Dennis and his
      wife Sally, Christine Lowery (wife of recently deceased Patrick Lowery),
      Linda, and John/Skip (her "third" son), grandnephews Daren, Michael, Tom
      and David, grandnieces Jaime, Joyce, Amy, Beth, and Caitlin, her brother
      John's spouse, Geraldine D'Amato, and her nephew Al Somers wife Betty, and
      nephew David Somers wife Judy. Ann's family invite friends to celebrate
      her life on Wednesday from 4-8 p.m. at Collins Funeral Home, 92 East
      Avenue, Norwalk. A mass of Christian Burial will be held at 10:30 a.m. on
      Thursday at St. Matthew Church, 216 Scribner Avenue, Norwalk, with burial
      to follow at St. John Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, Annie would be pleased
      if you would make a donation to any of the following: St. Matthew
      Recreational Center, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, or Homes for
      the Brave in Bridgeport, CT. Please visit www.collinsfh.com/obituaries to
